> "I’ll get you more pumpkin, I’ll ram it right up your ass." - Gordon Ramsay

Welcome everyone!

I'm delighted to share with you a recipe that is sure to warm you up in the coming fall and winter months. It's the tried and true recipe I like to call **Autumnal Pasta**. Its name comes from its orange color and use of root veggies freshly available during the fall. I also just made it up on the spot.

I won't bore you with too much recipe lore - after all, you're here to learn how to be a michellin star chef, not to read my life story. Well, even a chef like **Jamie Olliver** would take one bit of my pasta and go

> "🙀⁉️ This is the best thing I've put in my mouth since 2004. OMG" - probably Jamie Olliver

Let's get started!

## Preparing the food

### Serving Size

2-3 people with no leftovers

or

1 person with at least two days of leftovers

### Pasta Recommendation

I recommend using a medium/large pasta like **rotini**, **rigatoni**, or **farfalle**. This type of pasta is great at scooping up loads of the delicious sauce and delivering it to your mouth.

### Pasta Sauce Ingredients

- 1 large pumpkin squash, or two smaller ones
- A couple of big carrots. A good handful usually works for me. Add as much as you want
- 1-2 bell peppers. Red ones are great for adding complexity to the color
- 1 white onion
- Chicken or veggie broth
- 1 tbsp of Tomato Concentrate
- 1 can of Cream of Coconut
- Salt, pepper
- Olive oil
- 2 shallots (optional)
- 1 clove of garlic (optional)
- Red pepper flakes (optional)
- 1 tbsp Miso paste (optional)
- 1 tbsp butter (optional)

### Equipment you'll need

- Stand blender (or hand mixer)
- Nonstick pan
- Medium pot

## Directions

1. Cut up the veggies (squash, carrots, bell peppers, onion, shallot) into equal sized cubes

   _I find it very hard to squeeze cooked garlic out of its shell, so I usually peel it and add it to the roasting veggies._

2. Roast the veggies on high heat until they're fully cooked and soft.

   _Check with a fork if you're not sure if they're cooked. But it will taste even better if the veggies are charred._

3. Dump veggies into a blender. Add cream of coconut and chicken broth. Add the rest of your spices and sauces.

   _I don't have exact amounts here so I would recommend to add a little bit at a time, keep checking the consistency & taste. We are looking for the texture of a cream and mushroom, perhaps. Or whatever texture you like._

   ⚠️ If your blender is running hot, give it plenty of breaks to cool down ⚠️

4. If you chose to use the butter, throw it in now. This will make the sauce a bit more creamy and silky.

5. Let's cook the pasta! No instructions here. Just read the directions on the box. I like to cook my pasta al-dente.

   _Don't dump the pasta water out! Save a cup of it for the sauce for later_

6. In a large non-stick pan, heat up a tablespoon of olive oil. Add your blended sauce to the hot olive oil and let it marry its flavors with the miraculous properties of the olive oil

7. Add your drained pasta. Stir for 30 seconds, then add in a bit of the reserve pasta water. This should thicken the sauce a bit.

8. Once you are satisfied with the consistency, **serve and enjoy**!

I recommend you try this pasta with turkey meatballs. I don't have a recipe for that. But it pairs really well.

**Congrats! You have made your first Autumnal Pasta, and I just finished my first Scratchpad blog post. To many more!**
