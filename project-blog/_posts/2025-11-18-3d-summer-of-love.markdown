> "There is a dimension, beyond that which is known to man. It is a dimension as vast as space and as timeless as infinity" - Twilight Zone

I joined Scratchpad in an effort to expand beyond my software safe space and get into harder engineering disciplines. My first stop in that journey has been 3D printing. I purchased my first printer ever, a [Bambu Lab][bambu-lab] P1S. If you've got the spare cash, it's a wonderful machine to start with. Bambu Lab in general has a very robust ecosystem and is very beginner friendly.

Here's what she looks like!

My general mission with the printer has been to design from scratch some things I actually will use throughout my apartment.

Phase 1: Can Opener
I drink a lot of water from cans and have a particular fondness for spicy, flavored La Croix. I figured a nice dip into the 3D world would be to make my own can opener. At the end of the day, it's a rectangular handle and a little ramp to shove under the pop tab. When someone first gets into software, they always end up making a simple calculator app and this feels sorta like that.

Phase 2: Lattice
I've been amassing an army of plants and one poor, outdoor variant I received at my neices baptism, was really struggling. It could not support itself and was constantly following over and not getting any light. I made a simple spike and hexagon lattice to weave the plant through.

Phase 3: Soap Stand
I've been having fun with custom soaps (I bought some some at a Seattle street fair and then found a shop near my current place). These soaps need a stand so their glory is respected.

Phase 4: Jewellry Stand
I started an intro to Metalsmithing course at a local art studio and was constantly losing my little crafts. I decided to create a simple sombrero-like structure to house them.
