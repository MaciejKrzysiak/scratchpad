Binturongs, also known as bearcats, are neither bear or cat. They are something else entirely.

They have big tails and constant bed head.

**Listen, human.**
Do you have any idea what it’s like to be a binturong?

I wake up every morning smelling like buttered popcorn BUT I HAVE NEVER SEEN CORN.
I hang from branches with my prehensile tail, dangling above the void like some kind of furry noodle, wondering if this is what my ancestors wanted. Do binturongs even have ancestors? Or did we just arise, fully formed, as a cosmic joke God forgot to edit out?

Every day I wander the forest canopy, contemplating my place in the universe while making noises that sound like a creaky door trying its best. Am I predator? Am I prey? Am I just a damp raccoon someone spilled in the dryer and then lied about?

Sometimes tourists point at me.
“Wow, it’s a bearcat!” they say.
I AM NEITHER BEAR NOR CAT.
I am a liminal creature. An eldritch Snorlax. A furry question mark with anxiety.

At night, when the cicadas scream and the moon hangs too close, I stare into the darkness and the darkness stares back. And honestly? I wish it wouldn’t. I’ve got enough going on.

And still — still — I pretend everything is fine. I climb. I munch fruit. I pee on branches to mark them as mine, even though nothing is ever truly mine, not in a universe destined for heat death.

So if you ever feel lost, just remember:
Somewhere out there is a binturong, swinging through the trees, whispering into the humid night:

“What am I… and why do I smell like movie theater concessions?”
